# 3D Solar System Simulation â€“ Shaik Sharmin Kowshin 
This project simulates a vibrant 3D solar system with planets orbiting around the Sun using 
*Three.js*. You can interact with the simulation, explore the planets, and control the speed 
and themes (Dark/Light Mode). 
## How to Run 
1. *Download or Clone the Repository* - Download the entire project folder to your local machine. 
2. *Open in a Browser* - Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). 
3. *Interactive Features* - *Hover* over planets to see their names. - *Control Speed* using the sliders next to each planet. - *Pause/Resume* the animation by clicking the "Pause" button. - *Switch Themes* between Dark and Light modes using the "Light Mode" / "Dark Mode" 
button. 
##  Project Features - *Realistic Planetary Orbits*: Planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun. - *Planet Rings*: Outer gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) have custom-designed 
rings. - *Speed Control*: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet with interactive sliders. - *Tooltips*: Hover over planets to display their names. - *Dark/Light Mode*: Switch between dark and light themes to enhance visual appeal. 
## Tech Stack - *Three.js*: A 3D graphics library to create the solar system simulation. - *HTML5*: Used for structuring the web page. - *CSS*: For styling the web page and providing a dynamic interface. 
- *JavaScript*: Handles the animation, speed control, and interactions. 
## Planets in the Solar System 
1. *Mercury*: The smallest and fastest planet in the solar system. 
2. *Venus*: Known for its thick atmosphere and extreme temperatures. 
3. *Earth*: Our home planet, featuring a vibrant blue color. 
4. *Mars*: The red planet, known for its iron oxide surface. 
5. *Jupiter*: The largest planet, with a famous Great Red Spot. 
6. *Saturn*: Known for its stunning ring system. 
7. *Uranus*: An icy giant with a distinct tilt, giving it its unique ring system. 
8. *Neptune*: The farthest planet from the Sun, known for its deep blue color. 
## Instructions for Developers 
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file. 
2. Make changes to the *JavaScript* for additional planetary features or tweaks to the 
theme. 
3. Customize the *CSS* for more styling options or layout changes. 
4. If you want to add more planets or features, feel free to modify the existing code.
